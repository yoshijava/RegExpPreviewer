# RegExpPreviewer
A simple UI for checking regular expression

# Motivation
People usually are not familiar with regular expression enough. Therefore, a small "Test.java" would be created to see if the regexp coming out from your brain is correct. With this small program, you can paste your doc to match and input your regexp in the bottom field. This program would generate the matched string on the right-hand-side to help you correct regexp instantly.
